# google_vs_graph
Quick project that uses Google Suggest API to build a graph of terms Google considers relatives

I put this together for simple comparison research that I do often. My typical method of doing this is googling "subject vs" and looking through Google's suggestions to view alternatives.

This builds a graph of the suggested terms Google returns and the results from those terms, so it returns first and second degree related terms to the original search term.

Start by entering your search term in the textbox and hit enter. Double-click any node to make it the new central node.
